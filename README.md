# Segment Anything for Stable Diffusion WebUI

This **developed** branch attempts to enable [GroundingDINO](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO), achieving the goal of text prompt->object detection->segment anything->stable diffusion inpainting. 

Warning: You may need a long time to get GroundingDINO and its dependency build, because they have C++.

To use this extension, simply run `git checkout GroundingDINO` on your terminal after `cd` to this extension directory. This branch will be merged to master branch **VERY SOON**, when the merge conflicts are resolved.
